# ChickenEnclosure
Plans for enclosures for chickens, including 3D CAD models, manufacturing drawings, and sourcing guides. Variations for wheels, skids, and different sizes may be developed easily from a common base structure.

The first complete version of this enclosure uses u-bolts to attach the hoop to the frame.

[Download the full 3D CAD model, bill of materials and sourcing guide, and manufacturing drawings here.](https://github.com/somethingelse-skywoman/ChickenEnclosure/releases/tag/v1.0.0) This includes each of the necessary components and sub-assemblies to build the full frame.

As designed, the materials cost is just over $1700 (USD). Depending on the conditions in your area, 2 inch square tube with a thinner wall can be substituted for 2.5 inch tube. Both materials and links are listed in the sourcing guide. Smaller, thinner-walled material will reduce the cost considerably at the expense of strength and durability. 

The design is inspired by the APPPA design, [which can be found here](https://www.apppa.org/resources/Documents/building%20a%20multi%20purpose%20pasture%20shelter.pdf).

CAD models are made in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org), a free and open source modeling software.
Assemblies are made with the A2+ workbench, found in the Add-On Manager.
